## Welcome to Mariana! 💁

This theme has undergone many tweaks over the past few months and I'm excited to finally have an update for you all. 👌

You can see all the refinements and suggested settings at <https://github.com/mauroreisvieira/mariana-theme> as well as suggest any tweaks you may have.

**Many new things have been added, including:**

- Current file highlighting in sidebar
- Highlighted tab
- Dirty state tab pencil.
- Small tab refinements
- Auto complete, Goto aAything and Command Palette refinements
